📌 About This Project <br>
This Simple Keylogger, built using Python, records user keystrokes in the background and logs them to a file, typically used for monitoring, security analysis, or testing purposes.<br><br>

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This tool is intended for educational and ethical use only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.<br><br>

⌨️ What is Keylogging?<br>
Keylogging is the process of recording keystrokes on a keyboard. It is often used for:<br>
• Security Monitoring – Detecting unauthorized access or suspicious activities.<br>
• Parental Control – Monitoring children’s online activities.<br>
• Self-Analysis – Tracking personal typing habits and productivity.<br>
• Software Testing – Debugging and analyzing input behaviors.<br>
• Cybersecurity Research – Understanding and analyzing keylogging techniques for security purposes.<br><br>

💻 Technologies Used<br>
This project is implemented using the following technologies:<br>

1️⃣Programming Language:
• Python – Used for writing the core logic of the keylogger.<br>

2️⃣Libraries Used:
• pynput – Captures keyboard inputs in the background.<br>
• logging – Logs keystrokes into a text file for later review.<br>
• os – Handles file management and execution tasks.<br>
• datetime – Adds timestamps to recorded keystrokes.<br>
• threading – Ensures smooth execution without interrupting other processes.<br>
• json – Stores configuration settings for customization.<br><br>

✨ Features<br>
1️⃣ Keystroke Logging – Captures and records all keystrokes.<br>
2️⃣ Background Execution – Runs silently without disrupting user activity.<br>
3️⃣ Log File Storage – Saves keystrokes into a text file for later review.<br>
4️⃣ Time Stamping – Records the exact time of each keystroke.<br>
5️⃣ Customizable Logging Format – Allows users to modify how data is logged (e.g., plain text, JSON).<br>
6️⃣ Minimal Resource Usage – Optimized for efficient background execution.<br>
7️⃣ Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br>
8️⃣ Key Combination Detection – Recognizes specific key combinations and shortcuts.<br>
9️⃣ User-Friendly Log Management – Easily view, filter, and analyze recorded keystrokes.
